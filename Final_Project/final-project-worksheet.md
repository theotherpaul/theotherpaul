# Project Overview

## Project Description

This "Tender Button Generator" produces algorithmic poems based on Gertrude Stein's _Tender Buttons_, a "cubist" classic of modern poetry. Like Stein's book, this site is divided into three sections: "Objects," "Food," and "Rooms". Pushing a button generates a poem inspired by Gertrude Stein's syntax and vocabulary.

The toggle lets you read the original prose poems.
